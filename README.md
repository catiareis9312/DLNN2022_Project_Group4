Face expressions recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning model for predicting facial emotions. The approach was to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Techniques such as normalization and regularization were assessed. The results show that the best model has an F1-score of 0.50, and regularization techniques did not result in a reduction of overfitting. Furthermore, transfer learning was applied, but no improvement in results were observed. We considered that the dataset used might not be the best to obtain an efficient model for predicting facial emotions.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124466638/216788588-7c697932-eafc-44de-8b1f-c0edd46b18b5.png)
